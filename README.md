# ✌️ orca-touchdesigner-pilot-tox

I wanted to operate TouchDesigner and Pilot from ORCA.  
This is a simple tox that links ORCA, TouchDesigner, and Pilot.  
It receives UDP from Orca and parses it into CHOPs, and proxy to Pilot.

## 🤔 Why do I need to change the port?

I wanted to send notes from Orca to Pilot and TouchDesigner at the same time. However, one operator did not know how to send to both.

So I considered sending from Orca to TouchDesigner and then from TouchDesigner to Pilot.

### 🏃‍♀️ Flow

```
Orca == (UDP, port:49169) ==> TouchDesigner == (UDP, port:49161) ==> Pilot
```

## 🗺 Value mapping

### Channel
Divide into individual CHOP operators.  

### Octave
Receive values from "0" to "8" and map from "0" to "1".

### Note
Map the values of "A" to "Z" to receive "0" to "1". The lowest note is "C" and the highest note is "z". Sounds of the same pitch are mapped to the same value, depending on the scale. For example, "A" and "H" are the same, and "e" and "F" are the same.

### Velocity
Receives values from 0 to f and maps them from 0 to 1.

### Length
Receives values from 0 to f and maps them from 0 to 1.


## 🧐 I think there is another better way.

I'm sure Orca has an easier way, but I didn't know 🤔. Please let me know if you know.
